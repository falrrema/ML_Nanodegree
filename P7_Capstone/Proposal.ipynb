    "The digital transformation has completely changed our way of communicating between ourselves. Today most of our social relationships, work, and reading is done online. Although, online communication has been a great place for personal expression and insightful discussions it has also been a place for toxic and divisive content. The threat of abuse an online harassment, which derives from this toxic content, has been a growing concern this past few years. People who suffer from this divisive content usually stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. On the long run, this can become an existential problem in freedom of speech. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many well-known social and news media platforms have tackled this issue with online moderators, however, the immense amount of content that every day is generated makes this task extremely hard and most of the time futile. Hence, many platforms have turn to machine learning to identify, evaluate and support online moderators on this critical task. This has become a reality for big media platforms such as The Economist, Wikipedia, New York Times, and The Guardian. All of them have partnered with Google to experiment with their new Perspective API that helps them host better online conversations. \n"

    "Quora, on the other hand, is a platform that empowers people to learn from each other, thus it’s been a frequent target for abusive content. Quora wants also to attack this problem to keep their platform a place where users can feel safe sharing their knowledge with the world by hosting a Kaggle competition aimed at identifying insincere questions.
